# üß© Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## üìò Introduction
This repository serves as the foundation for the **Requirement Analysis Project**, which focuses on documenting, analyzing, and structuring software requirements for a **Booking Management System**.  

The goal of this project is to simulate a real-world software development scenario by performing detailed requirement analysis ‚Äî a crucial phase of the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)**.  

Through this project, learners will gain hands-on experience in gathering, defining, and documenting both **functional** and **non-functional** requirements, creating **use case diagrams**, and establishing **acceptance criteria** to ensure system clarity and alignment with business objectives.

## üéØ Purpose of the Repository
This repository is created to:
- Serve as a workspace for documenting the **requirement analysis phase** of the booking management system.  
- Provide structured and professional documentation using **markdown files** and **visual diagrams**.  
- Demonstrate best practices in **requirement engineering**, **use case modeling**, and **acceptance criteria definition**.  
- Prepare learners for **real-world software planning** and **client documentation processes**.  

## üß† Learning Objectives
By completing this project, learners will be able to:
- Master the principles and methodologies of **Requirement Analysis** in the SDLC.  
- Translate project needs into well-structured documentation.  
- Identify and categorize **functional** and **non-functional** requirements.  
- Use **Draw.io** (or similar tools) to visually represent system requirements.  
- Define **acceptance criteria** to align development goals with user expectations.  
- Apply **industry-standard documentation** and best practices.  

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements
To complete this project, ensure you have:
- A **GitHub account** with the ability to create repositories.  
- Knowledge of writing **markdown files** (README.md).  
- Understanding of the **SDLC** and the role of requirement analysis.  
- Experience using **Draw.io** (or equivalent) for creating system diagrams.  
- Access to the **Booking Management System case study** for reference.  

## üåü Key Highlights
- **Real-world Application:** Simulates practical software analysis and planning.  
- **Comprehensive Documentation:** Covers requirement gathering, categorization, and diagramming.  
- **Visual Representations:** Includes use case diagrams and actor interactions.  
- **Practical Insights:** Defines acceptance criteria and success metrics.  
- **Structured Learning Path:** Builds concepts step-by-step for clarity.  
- **Professional Standards:** Follows industry norms for requirement documentation.
